# R-BellabeatCaseStudy

This case study was a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate. This certification program had 7 courses followed by a capstone project in which learners we expected to combine all the concepts learnt throughout the course on a case. 

The data analysis process includes 6 phases :
1) Ask - ask effective questions and define the problem 
2) Prepare - identify the different data structures, formats and types present in your data. Make sure data is credible, unbaised and secured.
3) Process - this process involves cleanings and tronsforming data 
4) Analyse - sort and filter data to identify patterns and draw conclusions. Data- driven decisions can be made based on these conclusions and reccomendations can be provided.
5) Share - create data visualisations to bring data to life. Use effective communication to help stakeholders understand the results. 
6) Act - Apply your insights and make data-driven decisions. 

I have performed these steps of Data Analysis on the Fitbit dataset from Kaggle to derive insights on the use of smart fitness devices and provide reccomendations to Bellabeat on how they can improve their app for better growth. 

For this analysis, i have used both SQL and R programming. I have used ggplot2 for data visualisations. 

## Packages used 

1) Tidyverse 
2) proto, SQLite, sqldf - to be able to use SQL queries in R 
3) dplyr 
4) readr
5) ggplot2
6) lubridate
